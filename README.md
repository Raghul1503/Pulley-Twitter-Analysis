@Pulley Twitter Analysis

Introduction
This is a mini project that aims to gather some insights about the Twitter followers/following accounts of @Pulley's official handle.

This helps us assess the online presence of the company, and I was mainly interested with a few fundamental questions:-

1.What are the demographics of Pulley's followers, i.e where are they based?

2.What is the popularity of these followers/following users, and how many have a verified status?

3.What are these followers interested about, what kind of background do they have?

To answer these questions, I scrape through @Pulley's profile using Twitter API.
